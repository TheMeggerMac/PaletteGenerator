# PaletteGenerator
Created as a term project for the class CSCI-E10b from the Harvard Extension School. 

# Function
This program is designed to generate both randomized and focused color palettes. Clicking on a color will lock it into place and prevent further change. Once a single color is locked, click on one of the three 'hue shift' buttons to create a novel, hue-shifted color palette based on the locked color. 

# Enhancements
Some enhancements include the ability to export the color palette as a PDF, and to use the color palette in-app to draw a picture which you could export as well.
